sbase - suckless unix tools
===========================

sbase  is a  collection of  unix  tools that  are inherently  portable
across UNIX and UNIX-like systems.

The following tools are implemented:

'#'  -> UTF-8 support, '=' -> Implicit UTF-8 support, '*' -> Finished,
'|'  -> Audited,       'o' -> POSIX 2013 compliant,   'x' -> Non-POSIX,
'()' -> Petty flag

The  complement of  sbase  is  ubase[1] which  is  Linux-specific  and
provides all  the non-portable tools.   Together they are  intended to
form a base system similar to busybox but much smaller and suckless.

Building
--------

To  build sbase,  simply  type  make.  You  may  have  to fiddle  with
config.mk depending on your system.

You  can  also  build  sbase-box,  which  generates  a  single  binary
containing  all  the  required  tools.    You  can  then  symlink  the
individual tools to sbase-box or run: make sbase-box-install

Ideally you will  want to statically link sbase.  If  you are on Linux
we recommend using musl-libc[2].

Portability
-----------

sbase has been  compiled on a variety of  different operating systems,
including Linux, *BSD, OSX, Haiku, Solaris, SCO OpenServer and others.

Various combinations of operating  systems and architectures have also
been built.

You can build sbase with gcc, clang, tcc, nwcc and pcc.
